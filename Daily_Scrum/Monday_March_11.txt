Chintan:

What did you do yesterday?
Worked on updating the database to capture all of our reuqirements. Added information about calories, carbs, fats, proteins, prep time, equipment, and diet category for 400 meals. Fixed search functionality.

What will you do today?
I will work on implementing all functionality that is not dependent on our chatbot and work to finish the "Discover" page completely.

Is there anything in your way?
There was one issue with database connectivity, but it was resolved today.
